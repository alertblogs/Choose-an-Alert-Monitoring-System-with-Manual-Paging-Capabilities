Choose an Alert Monitoring System with Manual Paging Capabilities
========
Every second counts, particularly for a business operating in today’s highly competitive global marketplace. In a recent survey of more than 800 organizations, research and consulting firm Information Technology Intelligence Consulting (ITIC) found 98 percent of enterprises with more than 1,000 employees said a single hour of downtime per year cost over $100,000. Meanwhile, 81 percent of ITIC survey respondents reported the cost of downtime exceeded $300,000 per hour.

Alert monitoring systems with paging capabilities are available to help companies speed up incident management and response. These systems enable incident management teams across a business to connect with one another and troubleshoot and resolve incidents. Yet not all alert monitoring systems with paging capabilities are identical. And if you choose one that lacks manual paging capabilities, you could put your company, its employees and its customers in danger.

Some alert tracking systems drive automation and blast out lots of messages to large groups of incident management team members. These systems allow companies to notify their incident management teams about incidents and keep all team members up to date until issues are fully resolved. At the same time, sending out messages to all incident management team members – including those who are not directly involved in an incident – can be problematic. By bombarding incident management team members with messages, alert fatigue may develop across a team. Perhaps worst of all, incident management team members may begin to tune out certain messages over time.

If you’re on the lookout for an alert monitoring system, you should consider one that offers manual paging capabilities. Because if your system provides you with the ability to select incident management team members or groups and page stakeholders separately, you can ensure the right people are notified about each incident. Best of all, you can reduce the risk of alert fatigue and speed up incident management and response.

When it comes to alert tracking, there are many reasons why a business should choose a system that includes manual paging capabilities. These reasons include:

    Manual paging allows incident management team members to use a conference bridge to stay connected. Thanks to a conference bridge, incident management team members won’t have to worry about searching for dial-in instructions to join a group call. Instead, they can use a voice or email message to join a call.
    Incident management team members can send page-outs to large groups simultaneously.An alert monitoring system with manual paging capabilities enables incident management team members to instantly send alerts to multiple groups at the same time.
    Manual pages can be sent via a service desk app.By using an alert monitoring system with manual paging capabilities, incident management team members can assign a group and bridge number from a service desk and provide detailed status updates to a service desk in real-time.
    Incident management team members can take advantage of pre-built templates. Pre-built templates enable incident management team members to quickly page out for a major incident. Plus, topics can be assigned to specific teams to further accelerate incident management and response.
    Incident management teams can keep track of each person notified about an incident. An incident management system with manual paging capabilities keeps a record of every person who was alerted, along with alert method, escalations and acknowledgements for each alert.

If a company empowers its incident management teams with an alert monitoring system that features manual paging capabilities, it could help these teams become more productive and efficient than ever before. These teams also can use a state-of-the-art incident management system to reduce downtime, outages and other critical incidents. As a result, an alert monitoring system with manual paging capabilities could help a business improve its operations, lower its operating costs and much more.
